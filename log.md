Starting with the `binary.py` exercise, with the goal of distinguishing
one pitch from all others. Currently targeting C with varying weight,
including the octaves 3,4,5. Doing sets of 25 notes. I need to find a
sweet spot, where I get about 80% correct.

## Results

1. Weight 0.8: 25/25
2. Weight 0.7: 25/25
3. Weight 0.6: 23/25
4. Weight 0.5: 23/25
5. Weight 0.4: 25/25
6. Weight 0.3: 24/25
7. Weight 0.2: 22/25
